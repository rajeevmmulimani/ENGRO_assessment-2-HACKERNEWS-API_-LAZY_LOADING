Welcome to the ENGRO_assessment-2-HACKERNEWS-API_-LAZY_LOADING !

This module was initiated as a part of an assessment for ENGRO PoC, and serves as a tool to portrait the implementation of flask requests, json, threading and numpy libraries combined in creating dynamic data-set to fetch this real-time data onto a webpage which shows top 10 stories from HACKERNEWS and lazy loads as the feeding gets updated, this module pulls data from hackernews api and loads it onto an webpage using flask framework.

The window console supports any system default browser running this module.

The module takes feeding api from https://github.com/HackerNews/API and deprecates the data into text and json consecutively, lists the top stories available as title and clicking read more opens the story source site showing up detailed story.

To start with read the requirement text file available on this repository and open any browser, type http://127.0.0.1:5000

That's all folks, enjoy developing !!!
